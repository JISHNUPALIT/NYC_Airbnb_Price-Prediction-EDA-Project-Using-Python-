## Project Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis on New York Airbnb listings in order to:
- Understand key drivers of listing prices
- Visualize geographic and categorical trends
- Prepare the dataset for price prediction
- Engineer new features for improved insights

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment

---

## Dataset Overview

- **File**: `NewYork_airbnb_listings.csv`
- **Rows**: 20,770
- **Columns**: 22 features including:
  - `price`, `room_type`, `neighbourhood_group`, `availability_365`, `number_of_reviews`, etc.

---

## Data Cleaning

- Removed rows with missing values (`dropna`)
- Removed duplicate entries (`drop_duplicates`)
- Changed data types for appropriate interpretation (e.g., `id` and `host_id` cast to `object`)

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Analysis
- **Price Distribution**: Majority of listings under \$1500; outliers heavily skew data
- **Availability**: Listings range from seasonal to year-round

### Feature Engineering
- Created new feature: `price per bed`
- Calculated average price per neighborhood group:
  - Manhattan: \$204.15
  - Brooklyn: \$155.14
  - Queens: \$121.68
  - Staten Island: \$118.78
  - Bronx: \$107.99

### Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- **Price by Neighborhood & Room Type**: Manhattan shows highest prices across all room types
- **Price vs Number of Reviews**: No strong linear trend
- **Geographical Visualization**: Clusters of listings around central NYC
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Weak to moderate correlation among numerical features

---

## Key Insights

- **Manhattan is the most expensive borough**, largely due to location and demand
- **Room type significantly influences price**, with entire homes costing the most
- **Price per bed** is a useful normalization for comparing listings
- **Visual trends** highlight geographic and categorical impacts on price

---

## Recommendations
- **For Guests**: 
   - Look for listings with high availability and good reviews for a better experience.
   - **Private rooms** in Brooklyn offer affordable stays compared to Manhattan.

- **For Hosts**:  
   - Improve **availability** and **review response rates** to attract more bookings.
   - Manage pricing effectively to compete within the borough's market.

---

## Limitations & Future Work
- Outliers should be treated more rigorously in future modeling
- Missing data was dropped, which may reduce dataset representativeness
- **Future Work**: Build a predictive model using regression or machine learning techniques

---

## Conclusion
This project offers valuable insights into the New York Airbnb market, helping both guests and hosts make informed decisions. By using **EDA techniques**, we identified key trends and developed actionable recommendations. Future improvements can involve advanced analytics and predictive modeling to further enhance the findings.
